# Topology-Data-Analysis-Betti-Numbers-of-that-data-using-a-witness-complex
The GitHub repository contains a MATLAB implementation of Topology Data Analysis Betti Numbers using a witness complex. The code is based on the work from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47009-topological-data-analysis-learning-code but has been modified to fix error issues.

The witness complex is a popular method for analyzing high-dimensional data and capturing its topological structure. The Betti numbers of this data provide valuable insights into its topology, such as the number of connected components or the number of holes in the data.

Overall, this repository provides a useful resource for those interested in implementing Topology Data Analysis Betti Numbers using a witness complex in MATLAB. The code has been modified to address known error issues, making it a more reliable tool for analyzing high-dimensional data and extracting key insights about its topological properties.
